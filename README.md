In 2016, I developed a Minecraft stronghold calculator to address a common challenge I faced while playing the game. <br>
In the early stages of Minecraft, locating a stronghold, a crucial structure, proved to be a tedious task. <br>
In response to this issue, I designed a program to streamline the process using only two ender pearls.<br>


The program's functionality involves entering specific details: the precise position from which the ender pearl is thrown and the angles at two distinct locations.<br>
By inputting this information, the program employs triangulation to compute the coordinates of the stronghold.<br>
The resulting coordinates not only pinpoint the stronghold's location in the overworld but also provide its corresponding position in the Nether dimension.<br>
This tool significantly simplifies the task of finding strongholds in Minecraft, enhancing the overall gaming experience.<br>

Those are the inputs of the code:

And this is what the console displays:
